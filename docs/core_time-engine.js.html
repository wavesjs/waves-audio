 * Base class for time engines
 *
 * A time engine generates more or less regular events and/or plays back a
 * media stream. It implements one or multiple interfaces to be driven by a
 * master (i.e. a Scheduler, a Transport or a PlayControl) in synchronization
 * with other engines. The provided interfaces are scheduled, transported,
 * and play-controlled.
 *
 *
 * #### The `scheduled` interface
 *
 * The scheduled interface allows for synchronizing an engine to a monotonous time
 * as it is provided by the Scheduler master.
 *
 * ###### `advanceTime(time :Number) -> {Number}`
 *
 * The `advanceTime` method has to be implemented by an `TimeEngine` as part of the
 * scheduled interface. The method is called by the master (e.g. the scheduler).
 * It generates an event and to returns the time of the next event (i.e. the next
 * call of advanceTime). The returned time has to be greater than the time
 * received as argument of the method. In case that a TimeEngine has to generate
 * multiple events at the same time, the engine has to implement its own loop
 * while(event.time &lt;= time) and return the time of the next event (if any).
 *
 * ###### `resetTime(time=undefined :Number)`
 *
 * The `resetTime` method is provided by the `TimeEngine` base class. An engine may
 * call this method to reset its next event time (e.g. when a parameter is
 * changed that influences the engine's temporal behavior). When no argument
 * is given, the time is reset to the current master time. When calling the
 * method with Infinity the engine is suspended without being removed from the
 * master.
 *
 *
 * #### The `transported` interface
 *
 * The transported interface allows for synchronizing an engine to a position
 * (i.e. media playback time) that can run forward and backward and jump as it
 * is provided by the Transport master.
 *
 * ###### `syncPosition(time :Number, position :Number, speed :Number) -> {Number}`
 *
 * The `syncPositon` method has to be implemented by a `TimeEngine` as part of the
 * transported interface. The method syncPositon is called whenever the master
 * of a transported engine has to (re-)synchronize the engine's position. This
 * is for example required when the master (re-)starts playback, jumps to an
 * arbitrary position, and when reversing playback direction. The method returns
 * the next position of the engine in the given playback direction
 * (i.e. `speed &lt; 0` or `speed > 0`).
 *
 * ###### `advancePosition(time :Number, position :Number, speed :Number) -> {Number}`
 *
 * The `advancePosition` method has to be implemented by a `TimeEngine` as part
 * of the transported interface. The master calls the advancePositon method when
 * the engine's event position is reached. The method generates an event and
 * returns the next position in the given playback direction (i.e. speed &lt; 0 or
 * speed > 0). The returned position has to be greater (i.e. when speed > 0)
 * or less (i.e. when speed &lt; 0) than the position received as argument of the
 * method.
 *
 * ###### `resetPosition(position=undefined :Number)`
 *
 * The resetPosition method is provided by the TimeEngine base class. An engine
 * may call this method to reset its next event position. When no argument
 * is given, the time is reset to the current master time. When calling the
 * method with Infinity the engine is suspended without being removed from
 * the master.
 *
 *
 * #### The speed-controlled interface
 *
 * The "speed-controlled" interface allows for syncronizing an engine that is
 * neither driven through the scheduled nor the transported interface. The
 * interface allows in particular to synchronize engines that assure their own
 * scheduling (i.e. audio player or an oscillator) to the event-based scheduled
 * and transported engines.
 *
 * ###### `syncSpeed(time :Number, position :Number, speed :Number, seek=false :Boolean)`
 *
 * The syncSpeed method has to be implemented by a TimeEngine as part of the
 * speed-controlled interface. The method is called by the master whenever the
 * playback speed changes or the position jumps arbitarily (i.e. on a seek).
 *
 *
 * &lt;hr />
 *
 * Example that shows a `TimeEngine` running in a `Scheduler` that counts up
 * at a given frequency:
 * {@link https://rawgit.com/wavesjs/waves-audio/master/examples/time-engine.html}
 *
 * @example
 * import * as audio from 'waves-audio';
 *
 * class MyEngine extends audio.TimeEngine {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
